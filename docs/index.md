# extract_um_met

Extract meteorology from the Met Office **Unified Model (UM)** — iris `.pp` files
archived on JASMIN — into analysis-ready yearly [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) stores.

The UM archive is not laid out for analysis: it is thousands of gzipped `.pp`
files, split across time blocks and geographic tiles, on a grid whose resolution
changes partway through the record. `extract_um_met` is one command that pulls
the tiles your region needs, joins them, regrids them onto a target you define,
and appends the result to a single Zarr store per year.

```bash
python -m extract_um_met run --domain SA --date 2016
# → {zarr_save_directory}/SOUTHAMERICA/SOUTHAMERICA_Met_2016.zarr
```

## How the UM archive is organised

Two things shape everything else in this tool: **Mk blocks** (how the archive is
split in time) and **world regions** (how it is split in space).

### Mk blocks — the time axis

From 2011 the UM is released in numbered **"Mk" blocks**, each covering a date
range at a fixed native resolution. The resolution *changes between blocks*,
which is why regridding onto a stable target grid is part of the job:

| Mk | Dates | Native (Δlat × Δlon) | Status |
| --- | ----- | -------------------- | ------ |
| Mk6 | Jan 2011 – Mar 2013 | 0.234° × 0.352° | extractable |
| Mk7 | Apr 2013 – Jun 2014 | 0.234° × 0.352° | extractable |
| Mk8 | Jul 2014 – Jul 2015 | 0.156° × 0.234° | extractable |
| Mk9 | Aug 2015 – Jun 2017 | 0.156° × 0.234° | extractable |
| Mk10 | Jul 2017 – May 2022 | — | symlinked to `/badc/`, **not accessible** |
| Mk11 | Jun 2022 – | — | symlinked to `/badc/`, **not accessible** |

You never set the Mk yourself — give a `--date` and the block is resolved in
code. In practice this means **2011-01 … 2017-06 is what you can extract today**;
any later date reports missing files.

### World regions — the space axis

Each timestep of the global archive is split into **14 tiles**. A domain declares
which tiles it overlaps; the pipeline extracts each one and joins them:

![The 14 world regions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6dc8296-f87f-4d82-bcf5-533147d8e9a3)

Global data is 3-hourly on 59 model levels, so one year of one domain is a few
thousand tile-files reduced to a single store.

## The three data types

The UM global archive is the centre of this tool. Two limited-area products are
supported by the same machinery, at earlier stages of readiness:

| Data type | What it is | Status |
| --------- | ---------- | ------ |
| **`UM_Global`** | Global UM, 14 tiles, L59, 3-hourly | **working** (Mk6–9) — the main path |
| `UM1p5km` | 1.5 km UK limited-area (UKV), rotated pole, 16 UK tiles, L57, hourly | region bounds not generated yet |
| `NZCSM` | New Zealand convective-scale, rotated pole, one file per timestep, L70, hourly | partial — 12 variables ship, stresses deferred |

Structural properties (grid type, tiling, levels, cadence) are code-defined in
`sources.py`; only archive **paths** are per-environment. See
[Data types & grids](how_to_datatypes) for the full picture.

## Configuring it

Everything you run is driven by `config.yaml`, copied from the versioned
`config.example.yaml`:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml    # then edit — your copy is git-ignored
```

The shared structure — domains, data-type archive paths, grid specs — is what
lives in the example file. The genuinely personal parts are your scratch and
output paths, and `met_extract_author` for provenance.

### Adding a domain

A domain is **config only, no code**. Declare the region, the tiles it overlaps,
and the grid you want it on:

```yaml
domains:
  MYDOMAIN:
    domain_name: "MY_DOMAIN"                 # used in output paths / provenance
    footprint: "my_reference_footprint.nc"   # for footprint mode
    world_regions_codes: [6, 7]              # tiles it overlaps
    grid:
      mode: footprint                        # footprint | regular | native
      edge_size_lat: [100, 100]
      edge_size_lon: [85, 100]
```

Not sure which tiles you need? Ask:

```python
from extract_um_met.regions import find_overlapping_regions
find_overlapping_regions(min_lat=-25, max_lat=15, min_lon=-75, max_lon=-30)
```

Then dry-run, smoke-test one day, and only then run the year:

```bash
python -m extract_um_met run --domain MYDOMAIN --date 201601 --dry-run
python -m extract_um_met run --domain MYDOMAIN --date 20160115
python -m extract_um_met run --domain MYDOMAIN --date 2016
```

To extract an existing domain onto a *different* grid, don't add a second domain
— use `--grid-mode` with a `--suffix` so the variant sits beside the main store.

## Quick start

```bash
cd extract_um_met
module purge && module load jaspy                              # JASMIN Python env
export TMPDIR=/work/scratch-pw5/$USER/tmp && mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml                             # then edit your copy
python -m extract_um_met make-native-grid --sample-date 201601  # one-off
python -m extract_um_met run --domain SA --date 20160115        # single-day smoke test
```

## Output

One yearly Zarr store per domain, dims `time × levels × lat × lon`, float32 with
zstd compression, carrying CF and provenance attributes. Three grid modes are
available — `footprint` (default), `regular`, and `native` — set per domain.
